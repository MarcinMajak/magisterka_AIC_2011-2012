Jak opisać co to jest lower approximation and upper approximation:

The lower approximation of the set consists
of all the samples that can be described as definitely
belonging to the set, “positive cases”, whilst the upper
approximation of the set consists of all the samples that are
described as possibly belonging to the set, “possible cases”

clustering method is presented [3] and adopted for data
discretization before attribute reduction. This method has
advantages such as embedded flexibility regarding the level
of granularity and ease of handling any forms of similarity
or distances. It can be divided into agglomerative and
divisive algorithms.

Główna zaleta RoughSet:

An important idea of rough sets is to remove redundant
attributes where there is a large amount of sample data.
Elimination of redundant attributes can help identify strong,
non-redundant classification rules. The rough set method
for feature selection is particularly useful for dealing with
imprecise, inconsistent and overlapping information.

tego uzywac i jak ogolnie to trzeba zrobic.

The most important fact about Rough Sets is that feature 
reduction is NP-hard problem.
The computation of all minimal
length decision rules in order to manage the uncertainty in ex-
pert systems was proposed by Grzymala-Busse [2]. A variable
precision model of rough sets was generalized and introduced
by Ziarko [3]. The incremental identification of decision rules
was proposed by Skowron et al. [4], whose study also elabo-
rated the discernibility matrices and functions. Shan et al. [5]
proposed an incremental algorithm for identifying all minimal
length decision rules. WZIETE Z ARTYKULU art_40.pdf

Model decision table include condition attributes, condition attribute
values and decision classes.

firstly we have to find lower approximation which gives certain decision
about class of a given object x. This is the first step before going into 
deriving decision rules of minimal length.

Generally when we talk about rough set we have information system 
and a decision system. The former includes a finite set of objects and
attributes. A decision system deals with condition attribute values.

However,
there are some differences in describing the uncertainty and
incomplete knowledge. Fuzzy sets emphasize the vagueness
of a set, but rough set theory base on the indiscernibility of
objects in universe. The method of rough sets is the

Czy jest ogólnie istota rozpoznawania:
A role of classification is to classify objects, events and
real-life situations into classes. Each of the reviewed
objects is unique, original and its classification means a
certain degree of generalization. Let’s define a system
for the particular objects i.e. input and output variables,
elements (objects) and their mutual relations. Defining
and collecting the data of input/output variables cannot
be generalized, even though this stage influences the
classification result. An application of classification
methods based on computational intelligence (CI)
represents an effective tool for realization of a
classification model.

Every investigated object is connected to a specific piece
of information, to specific data. The objects which are
characterized by the same pieces of information are
mutually undistinguishable from the point of view of the
accessible pieces of information. This is expressed in
RST by the indiscernibity relations.


Values of attribute
may be uncertain because of many reasons. Generally
we can define four types of uncertainty: discretization of
quantitative attributes; imprecise values of quantitative
attribute; multiple values of attribute and unknown or
missing values of attribute.

The assumption that objects can be seen only through
the information available about them leads to the view
that knowledge has granular structure. Thus some
objects appear as similar and undiscerned. Therefore in
RST we assume that any vague concept is replaced by a
pair of precise concepts – the lower and the upper
approximation of the vague concept.

The effort to maximize accuracy leads to the
disproportionate rise of the number of definitions and
conditions.
The solution to deal with continuous valued attributes is to
partition numeric variables into a number of intervals and
treat each such interval as a category. This process of
partitioning continuous variables is usually termed as
discretization. Data can be reduced and simplified through
discretization. In case of continuous valued attributes, large
number of objects are generated with a very few objects
mapping into each of these classes.

Opisac na czym polega cross-validation:
Cross-Validation is a statistical method of evaluating
and comparing learning algorithms by dividing data
into two segments: one used to learn or train a model
and the other used to validate the model. In typical
cross-validation, the training and validation sets must
cross-over in successive rounds such that each data
point has a chance of being validated against. The basic
form of cross-validation is k-fold cross-validation.
Other forms of cross-validation are special cases of
k-fold cross-validation or involve repeated rounds
of k-fold cross-validation.

The theory of FSs, due to prof. Zadeh, is a
relatively new approach to uncertainty. In this
theory an element belongs to a set according to the
membership degree (membership function values)
[44,45,46], i.e. in a closed interval. It is an
enlargement of the traditional sets theory in which
an element either is or is not a set member. If we
endeavour to describe and model a particular reality
problem we encounter a certain discrepancy. On one
hand, there is the accuracy of mathematical methods
by which a specific problem is described and, on the
other hand, there is a very complicated reality
necessitating a range of simplifications and the
consequent inaccuracy, infidelity of the model
arising from them.

For our convenience in this paper four types of
uncertainty [41] need to be distinguished:
discretization of quantitative attributes; imprecise
values of quantitative attribute; multiple values of
attribute and unknown or missing values of attribute


The theory FSs and RST are now attracting attention
among researchers due to the representation of the
knowledge processing. These two theories
complement each other and as such they constitute
important components of CI. There are various
extensions of these two theories for processing.
The developments of rough and fuzzy extensions
to the data processing make the hybrid approaches
potentially rewarding research opportunities as well.
A rough-fuzzy approach [25] has two main lines of
thought in a hybridization of fuzzy and rough sets,
the constructive approach and the axiomatic
approach. The first one, generalized LA and UA are
defined based on fuzzy relations that are called
fuzzy-rough sets. The second [25] approach
introduces the definitions for generalized fuzzy LA
and fuzzy UA operators determined by a residual.
The assumptions are found that allow a given fuzzy
set-theoretic operator to represent LA or UA from a
fuzzy relation. Different types of fuzzy relations
produce different classes of fuzzy-rough set
algebras.

Intelligent pattern recognition systems have been success-
ful in many application areas. However, complex applica-
tion problems, such as reliable monitoring and diagnosis of
industrial plants and rapid detection and estimation of en-
vironmental changes, have emphasised the issue of knowl-
edge acquisition and modelling. These problems are likely
to present large numbers of features, not all of which will
be essential for the task at hand. Inaccurate and=or uncertain
values cannot be ruled out, either. Furthermore, such appli-
cations typically require convincing explanations about the
inference performed. A method to allow automated gener-
ation of knowledge models of clear semantics is, therefore,
highly desirable.
The most common approach to developing expressive and
human readable representations of knowledge is the use of
if-then production rules. Yet, real-life problem domains
usually lack generic and systematic expert rules for map-
ping feature patterns onto their underlying classes.
rough set theory [5], reduces
the dimensionality of potentially very large feature sets
without losing information needed for rule induction,
insofar as this is possible in the domain at hand. It
has an advantageous side-e ect in that it removes re-
dundancy from the historical data. This also helps sim-
plify the design and implementation of the actual pattern
classiÿer itself, by determining what features should be
made available to the system.

Na czym polega supervised i unsupervised learning?

The basic operators in rough set theory are approximations. There are at
least two approaches for the development of the rough set theory, the con-
structive and axiomatic approaches. In constructive approach, binary relations
on the universe, partitions of the universe, neighborhood systems, and Boolean
algebras are all the primitive notions. The lower and upper approximation
operators are constructed by means of these notions The constructive approach is suitable for practical applications of rough sets.
On the other hand, the axiomatic approach, which is appropriate for studying
the structures of rough set algebras, takes the lower and upper approximation
operators as primitive notions. In this approach, a set of axioms is used to
characterize approximation operators that are the same as the ones produced
by using constructive approach
On the other hand, by using an equivalence relation on
U , one can introduce lower and upper approximations in fuzzy set theory to
obtain an extended notion called rough fuzzy set [2,3]. Alternatively, a fuzzy
similarity relation can be used to replace an equivalence relation. The result is a
deviation of rough set theory called fuzzy rough sets

Najwazniejsze o co w tym wszystkim chodzi to idea crisp sets
In this paper we present a multi-scale method based on the hybrid notion of rough fuzzy sets, com-
ing from the combination of two models of uncertainty like vagueness by handling rough sets and
coarseness by handling fuzzy sets.
Rough sets embody the idea of indiscernibility between objects in a set, while
fuzzy sets model the ill-definition of the boundary of a sub-class of this
set. Marrying both
notions lead to consider, as instance, approximation of sets by means of
similarity rela-
tions or fuzzy partitions. The proposed multi-scale mechanism, based on the
model of
rough fuzzy sets, named C-calculus, introduced by Caianiello [9] is adopted to
spread
out local into more global information.
Fuzzy rough sets were proposed as a mathematical tool to deal with uncertainty. Noise is a main source of uncertainty
in real-world applications. We show that fuzzy rough sets are very sensitive to mislabeled samples. we introduce a
robust model of fuzzy rough sets in this work, called soft fuzzy rough sets and discuss the connections between the
soft fuzzy rough set model and other models. In addition, we design a soft fuzzy rough classifier based on the model.
