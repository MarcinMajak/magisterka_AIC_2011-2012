\section{Summary and conclusions}
\label{cha:Summary}
\subsection{Conclusions from conducted experiments}
In this paper the results of simulation investigations were presented. The main
purpose of five test scenarios was to evaluate prepared classifiers in case of
classification accuracy. Implemented and tested algorithms in this paper are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Basic Rough sets algorithm
    \item Rough sets algorithm with modification of decision rules
    \item Genetic Based Fuzzy Logic algorithm
    \item Multistage hybrid classifier using Rough sets and Fuzzy logic
\end{enumerate}
Author intention was to present the whole process of constructing complex
classifier from simpler ones. Researches started with the basic rough sets
algorithm. Because the results of classification were not satisfactory new
algorithm with modification of decision rules was introduced. Significant
improvement was visible for simple problems, but for multidimensional datasets
the classification accuracy was still poor. The next proposal consisted in
constructing multistage hybrid classifier where the power of fuzzy logic and
rough sets reasoning were connected. Original algorithm presented in this
thesis used genetic algorithm for finding the reduct of attributes and the
optimal granulation step for each attribute. Conducted test confirmed that
proposed algorithm can compete with other classifiers and obtains reliable
results. Next paragraph will shortly will shortly summarize each research.
