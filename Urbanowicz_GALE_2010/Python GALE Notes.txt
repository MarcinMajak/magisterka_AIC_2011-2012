NOTES: GALE Python Implementation

Summary: This python GALE implementation was written for the analysis published in the following paper:

R. Urbanowicz, J. Moore. The Application of Pittsburgh-Style Learning Classifier Systems to Address Genetic Heterogeneity and Epistasis in Association Studies.  PPSN 2010

This implementation was written with a SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism)/ (gene association study)-style environment in mind, and is presently set up to specifically
accommodate only that particular type of environment, where attribute values are discrete (0, 1, 2), and class status is known as either (0-control, 1-case).  A new
environment class may be written to adapt this python implementation to other data environments and rule representations.

Included with this implementation are two data files; a training file, and a testing file, which may be used to run this implementation locally using the GALE_Test.py file.
Alternatively GALE may be run from command line, passing all required arguments, using the file GALE_Main.py.

This script outputs the following: (1) a single text file tracking the performance of the algorithm at specified intervals over the entire run time. (2) a text file printing
 and summarizing the rule population (including testing and training evaluations) for each of the specified evaluation points (specified by the parameter learning iterations).
